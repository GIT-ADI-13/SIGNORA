# SIGNORA
SIGNORA – AI Sign Language to Text & Speech Translator
Signora is an AI-powered real-time Indian Sign Language translation system designed to make communication seamless between the hearing-impaired community and the general public.
It detects hand gestures through a camera, converts them into text, and further into speech, enabling natural, barrier-free interaction.

🌟 Features

🎥 Real-time Gesture Detection using OpenCV & Mediapipe

🔤 Gesture-to-Text Translation using ML models

🔊 Text-to-Speech Output

⚡ Fast & Lightweight

💻 User-friendly interface

🤝 Helps bridge communication gaps
